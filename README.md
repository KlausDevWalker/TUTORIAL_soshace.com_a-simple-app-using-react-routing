# Routing app

This is a repo created by following the tutorial in the link below:

=> https://soshace.com/this-is-how-i-created-a-simple-app-using-react-routing

There is a "live" version of it at codepen.io (done by the author):

=> https://codesandbox.io/s/supun-kavinda-react-router-app-7c7kr

I'm leaving this here for future reference and maybe to serve as a template in a future project.
